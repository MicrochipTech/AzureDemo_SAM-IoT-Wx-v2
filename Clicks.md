# Adding Extra Sensors to the SAM-IoT Wx v2 Development Board

The SAM-IoT Wx v2 Development Board, like many Microchip development boards, features a 16-pin (2 rows x 8 pins) expansion socket which conforms to the [mikroBUS™ specification](https://download.mikroe.com/documents/standards/mikrobus/mikroBUS-standard.pdf). The mikroBUS™ standard defines mainboard sockets used for interfacing microcontrollers or microprocessors (mainboards) with integrated circuits and peripheral modules (add-on boards).

The standard specifies the physical layout of the mikroBUS™ pinout, the communication and power supply pins used, the positioning of the mikroBUS™ socket on the mainboard, and finally, the silkscreen marking conventions for both the sockets. The purpose of mikroBUS™ is to enable easy hardware expandability with a large number of standardized compact add-on boards, each one carrying a single sensor, transceiver, display, encoder, motor driver, connection port, or any other electronic module or integrated circuit. Created by [MikroElektronika](https://www.mikroe.com), mikroBUS™ is an open standard — anyone can implement mikroBUS™ in their hardware design. MikroElektronika manufactures hundreds of ["Click" boards](https://www.mikroe.com/click) which conform to the mikroBUS™ standard.

## "Air Quality 9" Click Board

This demonstration supports the optional addition of the [Air Quality 9 Click](https://www.mikroe.com/air-quality-9-click) which is a compact add-on board containing a best-in-class air-quality sensing solution. This board features the ENS160, a digital multi-gas sensor solution based on metal oxide (MOX) technology with four MOx sensor elements from ScioSense. Each sensor element has independent hotplate control to detect a wide range of gases. The ENS160 series features TrueVOC™ air quality detection and supports intelligent algorithms, which calculate CO2 equivalents, TVOC, air quality index (AQI), and perform humidity and temperature compensation. This Click board™ is interface-configurable and characterized by outstanding long-term stability and lifetime. This Click board™ makes an excellent choice for detecting unhealthy air conditions, such as personal air-quality monitors, HVAC, smart thermostats, and other air quality-related applications.

## Stacking Multiple Click Boards

Any combination of up to 4 Click boards can be connected at the same time using the MikroElektronika [Shuttle Bundle](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus-shuttle-bundle) accessory kit. The bundle features the [Shuttle click](https://www.mikroe.com/shuttle-click) 4-socket expansion board, which provides an easy and elegant solution for stacking up to four Click boards™ onto a single mikroBUS™ socket. It is a perfect solution for expanding the capacity of the development system with additional mikroBUS™ sockets when there is a demand for using more Click boards™ than the used development system is able to support.
